## What Is an Additional Insured?

An additional insured is a person or entity that is added to another party's insurance policy, giving them certain coverage rights under that policy. In commercial real estate, this typically means the property owner, property management company, or lender is added to a vendor's or tenant's general liability policy as an additional insured.

The concept is straightforward: if a vendor causes bodily injury or property damage while working on your property, their insurance should respond first. Being listed as an additional insured on their policy gives your organization direct rights to make a claim under that policy — rather than having to sue the vendor and hope they have the resources to pay.

Additional insured status is not the same as being the named insured. The named insured is the policyholder — the vendor or tenant who purchased the insurance. Additional insureds are added by endorsement and typically have more limited rights than the named insured, but the critical right they gain is the ability to tender claims directly to the vendor's insurer.

## Why Property Managers Require Additional Insured Endorsements

In commercial real estate, requiring additional insured status is standard practice for good reason. It provides a direct line of defense when incidents occur.

**Direct claim rights.** Without additional insured status, if a vendor's work causes a visitor injury, the injured party might sue both the vendor and your organization. Your organization would need to rely on its own insurance and then seek contribution from the vendor's policy through subrogation — a process that is slow, uncertain, and expensive. As an additional insured, you can tender the claim directly to the vendor's insurer from the start.

**Defense cost coverage.** Additional insured endorsements typically include a duty to defend, meaning the vendor's insurer must provide legal defense for claims arising from the vendor's work. Legal defense costs alone can run into tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars even for claims that are ultimately dismissed.

**Contractual requirement.** Most vendor agreements and commercial leases in CRE explicitly require the vendor or tenant to name the property owner and management company as additional insured. Failing to verify this endorsement means the contract's risk transfer mechanism is not actually in place.

**Lender requirements.** Mortgage lenders frequently require that they be named as additional insured on tenant and vendor policies. This is often a condition of the loan agreement. Failure to maintain this documentation can constitute a covenant violation.

## How to Verify Additional Insured on a COI

Verifying additional insured status on a certificate of insurance requires checking multiple sections of the document.

### The Certificate Holder Section

The certificate holder section at the bottom of the ACORD 25 form shows who requested the certificate. Being listed as the certificate holder does **not** make you an additional insured. This is one of the most common misunderstandings in COI review. The certificate holder receives a copy of the certificate — that is all. It confers no insurance rights.

### The Description of Operations Section

This is where additional insured information most commonly appears on a COI. Look for language like:

- "Additional insured: [Your Entity Name] per attached endorsement CG 20 10"
- "[Your Entity Name] is included as additional insured with respect to general liability"
- "Additional insured per written contract"

The Description of Operations section is a free-text field, so the format varies widely. Property managers need to read this section carefully to confirm their entities are named.

### Endorsement References

Some certificates will reference specific endorsement forms like CG 20 10, CG 20 26, or CG 20 37. These are standard ISO additional insured endorsement forms. The presence of an endorsement reference is a positive indicator, but ideally you should also verify that the endorsement names your specific entities.

### The "ADDL INSD" Checkbox

On ACORD 25 forms, there is a checkbox column labeled "ADDL INSD" (additional insured) next to each coverage type. If this box is checked, it indicates that there is an additional insured endorsement on that policy. However, the checkbox alone does not tell you which entities are covered — you still need to verify the specific names in the Description of Operations section or on the actual endorsement.

## Common Mistakes with Additional Insured

After reviewing thousands of certificates, certain additional insured mistakes appear repeatedly.

### Relying on certificate holder status alone

As mentioned above, being listed as the certificate holder does not make you an additional insured. Many property managers assume that receiving a certificate means they are covered. They are not — unless their entity is specifically named as additional insured via endorsement.

### Wrong entity name

The certificate names "ABC Property LLC" as additional insured, but your legal entity is "ABC Property Management, Inc." Entity name mismatches can create problems during claims. The additional insured name should match exactly the entity specified in the contract or lease. If your organization has multiple entities, each one that needs coverage should be listed.

### Missing from specific coverage types

A vendor might add your entity as additional insured on their general liability policy but not on their automobile liability policy. If the contract requires additional insured status on both, verify it for each coverage type separately.

### "Per written contract" limitations

Some additional insured endorsements provide coverage only "per written contract" or "as required by written contract." This means the scope of your additional insured coverage is determined by the contract language, not the policy language. If the contract's insurance requirements are poorly drafted, the endorsement may provide narrower coverage than expected.

### Not checking for primary and noncontributory

Many contracts require that the vendor's insurance be "primary and noncontributory" for additional insureds. This means the vendor's policy pays first, without seeking contribution from your own insurance. Without this language, the vendor's insurer might argue that your own policy should share in the claim. Look for primary and noncontributory language in the Description of Operations section.

## How AI Can Verify Additional Insured Automatically

Manually checking additional insured status on every certificate is time-consuming and error-prone. The Description of Operations section is a free-text field with inconsistent formatting, making it easy to miss or misread entity names.

AI-powered tools like [SmartCOI](/coi-tracking-software) can automate this verification. When a certificate is uploaded, the AI reads the entire document — including the Description of Operations section — and identifies any entities listed as additional insured. It then compares those entity names against your configured requirements using fuzzy matching to catch minor variations in spelling or formatting.

This automated checking catches issues that manual review often misses: entity name mismatches, missing additional insured endorsements, and cases where the endorsement references a different policy than expected. The AI flags these issues immediately, before the vendor begins work, so they can be resolved proactively.

For property managers tracking dozens or hundreds of vendors across multiple properties, automated additional insured verification transforms what was previously the most tedious and risky part of COI review into an instant, reliable check.

## Key Takeaways

Additional insured endorsements are a critical component of risk transfer in commercial real estate. They give property owners, managers, and lenders direct rights under vendor and tenant insurance policies — rights that can make the difference between being protected and being exposed when incidents occur.

Verifying additional insured status requires more than glancing at the certificate holder section. Property managers need to read the Description of Operations, check endorsement references, verify entity names exactly match contract requirements, and confirm that the endorsement applies to the right coverage types.

Given the complexity and stakes involved, automated verification using [AI-powered COI tracking](/ai-coi-extraction) is becoming the standard for property management firms that take risk management seriously. Manual review will always have a place for judgment calls and edge cases, but the initial extraction and verification is a process that AI handles faster and more consistently than any human reviewer.
