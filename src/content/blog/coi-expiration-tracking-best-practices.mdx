## Why Expirations Are the Biggest COI Risk

Of all the compliance gaps that can appear in a certificate of insurance program, expired policies are the most common and the most dangerous. They are common because every insurance policy has an annual renewal date, which means every certificate in your system will expire at least once per year. They are dangerous because an expired policy means the vendor or tenant is operating without verified coverage — and you may not know it.

Unlike other compliance issues — insufficient limits, missing endorsements, wrong entity names — expirations are a ticking clock. A certificate that was perfectly compliant on the day it was issued becomes a liability exposure the day the policy expires without renewal. And unlike a limit shortfall, where partial coverage still exists, an expired policy may mean no coverage at all.

The fundamental challenge of expiration tracking is volume. A property management firm with 100 vendors and tenants has 100 different expiration dates to monitor, often spread across multiple coverage types per certificate. That is potentially 200-400 individual dates to track. Without a systematic approach, expirations will slip through.

## Why Expirations Slip Through the Cracks

Understanding why expirations get missed helps you build a process to prevent it.

**Reliance on memory.** Small teams often track expirations informally — someone remembers that the HVAC contractor's policy expires in March. This works until someone goes on vacation, gets busy with other priorities, or leaves the company. Institutional memory is not a compliance system.

**Spreadsheet overload.** Larger teams may track dates in a spreadsheet, but spreadsheets are passive. They do not alert you when a date approaches. Someone has to actively sort and review the spreadsheet regularly. If that review cadence slips — because of a busy month, a staffing change, or competing priorities — expirations go unnoticed.

**Annual renewal confusion.** When a vendor's policy renews, the new certificate may arrive as an email attachment from the vendor's broker. It goes into someone's inbox alongside dozens of other emails. If no one processes it promptly, the old certificate in your system shows as expired even though coverage was actually renewed. The coverage may exist, but your documentation does not reflect it.

**Multiple coverage types.** A single vendor may have general liability, auto liability, workers' comp, and umbrella policies — each with different carriers and different expiration dates. Tracking one date is manageable. Tracking four dates per vendor across 100 vendors is a process that demands automation.

**Portfolio growth.** What worked for a 20-vendor portfolio breaks down at 100 vendors. What worked for 2 properties breaks down at 10. The administrative burden grows with portfolio size, but staffing rarely keeps pace.

## The Liability Risk of Missed Expirations

When a vendor's insurance expires and no one follows up, the property management firm is exposed on multiple fronts.

**Direct liability.** If the vendor causes injury or damage while operating with expired coverage, the property owner may bear liability that should have been the vendor's responsibility. Courts have found property managers negligent for allowing uninsured vendors to work on their properties.

**Audit findings.** Lenders, investors, and insurance carriers audit COI compliance programs. An audit that reveals expired certificates — especially ones that expired months ago — raises serious questions about the firm's risk management practices. This can lead to increased insurance premiums, required remediation plans, or loss of management contracts.

**Breach of contract.** Vendor agreements and leases almost universally require that insurance be maintained throughout the term of the contract. An expired policy is a contract breach. If the property manager was responsible for verifying compliance, their failure to follow up may weaken their legal position in any related dispute.

**Insurance coverage implications.** Your own property insurance policy may include conditions requiring that all vendors maintain adequate coverage. If your carrier discovers that you allowed vendors with expired insurance to operate on the property, they may deny claims or increase premiums.

## Setting Up an Effective Tracking Cadence

The goal of expiration tracking is simple: no certificate should expire without someone knowing about it and taking action well in advance. Here is how to build that cadence.

### Start early: 60-day warnings

Begin monitoring certificates 60 days before expiration. This gives ample time for the renewal process to play out. The vendor needs to contact their broker, the broker needs to process the renewal, the new certificate needs to be issued and delivered. Starting at 60 days means there is no rush.

At the 60-day mark, send a friendly reminder to the vendor or tenant letting them know their certificate will expire soon. Frame it as a courtesy — most vendors appreciate the reminder because it helps them avoid coverage lapses too.

### Follow up at 30 days

If no updated certificate has been received by the 30-day mark, send a more direct follow-up. The message should clearly state the expiration date, specify what coverage needs to be renewed, and provide a straightforward way for the vendor to submit the new certificate (ideally a link to a [self-service upload portal](/features/vendor-management)).

### Escalate at 14 days

Two weeks before expiration, the communication should become more urgent. The vendor should understand that continued work on the property requires current insurance documentation. If the vendor is unresponsive, consider escalating to their primary contact at your organization or the property manager responsible for that vendor relationship.

### Final notice at 7 days

One week before expiration, send a final notice. This should clearly state the consequences of non-compliance — typically suspension of work authorization until a current certificate is provided. The goal is not to be adversarial but to create enough urgency that the vendor acts.

### Post-expiration protocol

If a certificate expires without a renewal on file, have a defined protocol. This might include: suspend the vendor from active work until compliance is restored, notify the property manager and asset manager, document the lapse in the vendor's compliance record, and confirm replacement coverage before allowing work to resume.

## How Automation Eliminates Missed Expirations

Manual tracking cadences work in theory but break down in practice due to the sheer volume of dates, the complexity of multi-policy tracking, and the inevitable gaps in human attention.

Automated COI tracking software like [SmartCOI](/coi-tracking-software) fundamentally solves this problem.

**Every expiration date is tracked automatically.** When a certificate is uploaded and processed, every expiration date — across every coverage type — is captured and monitored. No manual date entry needed.

**Notifications are sent on schedule.** The system sends reminders at your configured intervals (60, 30, 14, 7 days) without any human involvement. Reminders go out reliably regardless of staff vacations, workload fluctuations, or organizational changes.

**Vendor self-service.** Each notification includes a link to the vendor's upload portal where they can submit their updated certificate directly. This eliminates the email back-and-forth that often delays the renewal process.

**Dashboard visibility.** Property managers can see at a glance which certificates are approaching expiration, which are already expired, and which vendors have been notified. This portfolio-wide view makes it impossible for expirations to hide.

**Zero manual effort.** The entire cadence — from initial warning through escalation — runs automatically. Property managers only need to get involved when a vendor remains non-compliant after all automated notifications have been sent.

## Key Takeaways

Certificate expirations are the most common and most dangerous COI compliance gap. Every certificate expires at least once per year, creating a relentless cycle of monitoring and follow-up that overwhelms manual processes.

The best practice is a tiered notification cadence starting 60 days before expiration, with escalating urgency at 30, 14, and 7 days. But even the best-designed manual process will miss expirations as portfolio size grows.

Automated tracking eliminates missed expirations entirely. The system monitors every date, sends every notification, and surfaces every gap — without requiring anyone to remember, check a spreadsheet, or draft a follow-up email. For property management firms serious about risk management, automation is not a luxury — it is a necessity.
