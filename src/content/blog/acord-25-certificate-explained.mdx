## What Is the ACORD 25 Form?

The ACORD 25 is the standard Certificate of Liability Insurance form used across the United States insurance industry. ACORD (Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development) is the nonprofit organization that develops standardized forms for the insurance industry. The ACORD 25 form is by far the most common certificate format you will encounter as a property manager.

When a vendor, contractor, or tenant provides you with a "certificate of insurance" or "COI," they are almost always providing an ACORD 25 form (or occasionally an ACORD 28 for property insurance). Understanding this form is essential for anyone responsible for verifying insurance compliance.

The ACORD 25 is a one-page summary document. It does not grant coverage — it merely summarizes the policies in effect at the time the certificate was issued. This distinction matters because policies can be modified, cancelled, or allowed to lapse after the certificate is generated.

## The Header Section

The top of the ACORD 25 form contains several important fields.

**Certificate date.** The date the certificate was issued. This is not the policy effective date — it is when the document was generated. A recently issued certificate is more reliable than one issued months ago because it reflects the policy status at the time of issuance.

**Producer.** The insurance agent or broker who issued the certificate. The producer is the vendor's agent, not yours. If you need to verify information or request corrections, you may need to contact the producer — but the vendor should be your primary point of contact for certificate issues.

## The Insured Section

This section identifies the named insured — the entity that purchased the insurance policies. For COI verification purposes, this is the vendor or tenant whose compliance you are checking.

Verify that the named insured matches the entity in your contract or lease. If your agreement is with "ABC Contracting LLC" but the certificate shows "ABC Contracting, Inc." as the named insured, there may be a corporate structure issue that warrants investigation. The named insured should be the legal entity you have a contractual relationship with.

## Insurance Companies (Insurers)

The form lists up to five insurance companies (labeled Insurer A through Insurer E) that provide coverage. Each insurer is identified by name and a NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners) number. The NAIC number can be used to verify that the insurer is legitimate and licensed in the relevant state.

Different coverage types may be provided by different insurers. It is common for a vendor to have general liability with one carrier, workers' compensation with another, and automobile coverage with a third. The letter designation (A, B, C, etc.) connects each insurer to the coverage types listed below.

## Coverage Section: General Liability

The general liability section is typically the largest and most important part of the ACORD 25 for property managers. Here is what each field means.

**Type of insurance.** Most vendors carry "Commercial General Liability" (CGL). Look for checkboxes indicating the policy type — occurrence form vs claims-made form. Occurrence form is standard and preferred because it covers incidents that occur during the policy period regardless of when the claim is filed. Claims-made policies only cover claims filed during the policy period.

**Policy number.** The unique identifier for the general liability policy.

**Policy effective date and expiration date.** The period during which the policy is active. Both dates should be verified — the policy should be currently in effect and the expiration date should extend through the period when the vendor will be performing work.

**Limits.** The general liability section lists several limit types:

- **Each Occurrence:** The maximum the insurer will pay for a single incident. This is the limit most commonly specified in contracts. Typical requirements range from $500,000 to $2,000,000 per occurrence.
- **Damage to Rented Premises:** Coverage for damage to premises rented to the insured. Relevant for tenants.
- **Medical Expense:** Coverage for minor medical expenses regardless of fault. Usually a small amount ($5,000-$10,000).
- **Personal & Advertising Injury:** Coverage for claims of libel, slander, false arrest, and similar offenses.
- **General Aggregate:** The total maximum the insurer will pay for all claims during the policy period (except products/completed operations). This is typically twice the per-occurrence limit.
- **Products/Completed Operations Aggregate:** A separate aggregate for claims arising from the insured's products or completed work.

When checking compliance, focus on the **Each Occurrence** and **General Aggregate** limits, as these are most commonly specified in contracts and leases.

## Coverage Section: Automobile Liability

If the vendor operates vehicles on or near your property, automobile liability coverage is important.

**Combined Single Limit (CSL).** The maximum the insurer will pay for a single auto accident, combining bodily injury and property damage. Common requirements are $500,000 to $1,000,000 CSL.

**Type checkboxes.** Look for "Any Auto" which provides the broadest coverage. "Owned Autos Only" or "Hired Autos" provide narrower coverage that may not be sufficient.

## Coverage Section: Workers' Compensation

Workers' compensation coverage is required by law in most states for employers. The certificate should show the statutory limits for the applicable state.

**WC Statutory Limits.** The checkbox indicating that the policy meets the state's statutory requirements. This should be checked.

**Employers' Liability limits.** Additional coverage beyond statutory workers' comp:
- **Each Accident:** Per-accident limit, typically $500,000 to $1,000,000.
- **Disease - Each Employee:** Per-employee disease limit.
- **Disease - Policy Limit:** Aggregate disease limit.

If a vendor's employee is injured on your property and the vendor does not have workers' comp coverage, the injured worker may file a claim against your organization. Always verify this coverage is current.

## Coverage Section: Umbrella / Excess Liability

Umbrella or excess liability provides additional coverage above the limits of underlying policies (general liability, auto, workers' comp). Contracts for higher-risk work often require umbrella coverage.

**Each Occurrence and Aggregate.** These limits sit on top of the underlying policy limits. For example, if the vendor has $1M per occurrence in general liability and $5M in umbrella coverage, the effective per-occurrence limit is $6M.

## Description of Operations / Locations / Vehicles

This is the free-text section at the bottom-center of the form and is one of the most important sections for property managers to review. It contains information that does not fit into the structured fields above, including:

**Additional insured entities.** This is where you will most often find confirmation that your organization is listed as additional insured. Look for your exact entity name and the endorsement form number (e.g., CG 20 10, CG 20 26).

**Waiver of subrogation.** Notation that the vendor's policies include a waiver of subrogation in favor of your entities.

**Primary and noncontributory.** Language indicating that the vendor's insurance is primary and will not seek contribution from your own policies.

**Project or location specific information.** Some certificates specify the property address or project name to which the coverage applies.

Read this section carefully. It is free-form text, so formatting varies widely between brokers. Critical information is sometimes buried in dense paragraphs. [AI-powered extraction tools](/ai-coi-extraction) can parse this section automatically, identifying entities and endorsements that manual review might miss.

## Certificate Holder Section

The certificate holder section at the very bottom of the form identifies who requested the certificate and where it should be mailed. **Being listed as the certificate holder does not make you an additional insured.** This is the single most common misconception in COI review.

The certificate holder simply receives a copy of the certificate. It grants no insurance rights whatsoever. Do not confuse certificate holder status with additional insured status — they are completely different.

Verify that your organization's name and address are correct in this section, but understand that the real coverage rights come from the additional insured endorsement, not the certificate holder designation.

## Common Mistakes in Reading ACORD Forms

### Confusing certificate holder with additional insured

As discussed above, this is the most frequent error. Certificate holder status is administrative. Additional insured status is a coverage right. They are different things.

### Not checking all coverage types

Reviewing only general liability and ignoring workers' comp, auto, or umbrella coverage. Each coverage type should be verified against your requirements independently.

### Ignoring the policy form

Occurrence form and claims-made form are not interchangeable. If your contract requires occurrence form general liability, a claims-made policy may not satisfy the requirement.

### Not reading the Description of Operations

Skimming past the free-text section means missing additional insured designations, waivers of subrogation, and other critical endorsement information.

### Assuming current validity

A certificate reflects policy status at the time of issuance. If the certificate is six months old, the policies may have been cancelled or modified since it was generated. Always check the expiration dates and request current certificates for policies approaching renewal.

## How AI Reads ACORD Forms

Manually reading and verifying ACORD 25 forms is a skill that takes time and attention. For property managers processing dozens or hundreds of certificates, the volume makes consistent manual review impractical.

[SmartCOI's AI extraction](/ai-coi-extraction) reads ACORD forms the way a trained professional would, but in seconds rather than minutes. The AI understands the form layout, identifies each coverage section, extracts all limit values with correct categorization, reads policy dates, identifies the named insured, and parses the Description of Operations for additional insured entities and endorsement references.

The extracted data is then automatically compared against your configured requirements, providing an instant compliance assessment. This combination of accurate extraction and automated compliance checking transforms COI review from a tedious manual process into a fast, reliable workflow.

For property management teams handling ongoing COI compliance across portfolios, understanding the ACORD 25 form structure is foundational knowledge. Whether you review certificates manually or use AI-powered tools, knowing what each section contains and where to find critical information ensures that your compliance verification is thorough and effective.
