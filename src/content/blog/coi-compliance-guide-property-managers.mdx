## What Is a Certificate of Insurance?

A Certificate of Insurance (COI) is a one-page document — typically an ACORD 25 form — that summarizes a company's active insurance policies. It lists the types of coverage carried, policy limits, effective and expiration dates, the named insured, and any additional insured parties.

For commercial property managers, COIs are the primary way to verify that vendors, contractors, and tenants carry the insurance coverage required by their contracts or leases. A general contractor performing a roof replacement, a janitorial company servicing common areas, or a restaurant tenant operating on the ground floor — all of them should provide a current COI that meets your property's requirements before work begins or a lease takes effect.

The COI itself does not grant coverage. It is a snapshot, a summary issued by the insured party's insurance agent. It confirms that coverage existed at the time the certificate was issued. This distinction matters because policies can be cancelled, modified, or allowed to lapse after a COI is generated.

## Why Property Managers Need to Track COIs

COI tracking is not optional. It is a core risk management responsibility for any commercial property operation. Here is why it matters:

**Contractual obligations.** Most vendor agreements and commercial leases include insurance requirements. If a vendor or tenant operates without adequate coverage and an incident occurs, the property owner may be exposed to liability that should have been covered by the third party's policy.

**Lender and investor requirements.** Mortgage lenders and equity partners often require property managers to maintain evidence that all third parties carry appropriate insurance. Failing an audit can trigger covenant violations or loss of financing.

**Claims protection.** When an accident happens on your property — a slip and fall, water damage from a tenant's negligence, an injury on a construction site — the first question an attorney will ask is whether the responsible party had insurance. The second question is whether you verified it. If you cannot produce a current, compliant COI, your organization may bear a disproportionate share of the liability.

**Lease enforcement.** Insurance requirements are lease provisions, just like rent and maintenance obligations. Inconsistent enforcement weakens your position if you ever need to pursue a claim or enforce other lease terms.

## Common COI Compliance Gaps

After reviewing thousands of certificates, certain compliance gaps appear again and again. Understanding these patterns helps you know what to look for.

### Expired policies

This is the most common gap. A vendor provides a COI when they first begin work, but the policy expires six months later and no one follows up. The vendor is still on-site, still performing work, but now operating without verified coverage. Expirations are particularly dangerous because everything looks fine on paper until you actually check the dates.

### Insufficient limits

Your lease or contract may require $1,000,000 per occurrence in general liability, but the vendor's policy only carries $500,000. Limit shortfalls are easy to miss when you are reviewing certificates manually, especially when you manage dozens or hundreds of vendors across multiple properties.

### Missing additional insured endorsement

Being listed as an additional insured on a vendor's policy gives your organization direct rights under that policy. Many contracts require it, but the endorsement is frequently missing from the COI or is listed in the description of operations section rather than as a formal endorsement. Without it, you may not have standing to make a claim under the vendor's policy.

### Wrong entity listed

The COI names "ABC Property LLC" as the additional insured, but your entity is "ABC Property Management, Inc." This mismatch can create problems during claims. The certificate holder and additional insured names should exactly match the entities specified in the contract or lease.

### Missing coverage types

A roofing contractor might carry general liability but not workers' compensation. A technology vendor might lack cyber liability coverage. Each vendor type has different risk profiles and should meet requirements tailored to the work they perform.

### Waiver of subrogation missing

A waiver of subrogation prevents the vendor's insurance company from suing your organization to recover money it paid on a claim. Many contracts require this endorsement, and it is frequently missing or not indicated on the certificate.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

The consequences of poor COI tracking range from inconvenient to catastrophic.

**Direct liability exposure.** If a vendor causes damage or injury and their insurance is expired or insufficient, your organization may be named in the lawsuit. Without proper coverage verification, you may struggle to shift liability back to the responsible party.

**Lease violations.** Tenants operating without required insurance are in default of their lease. If you have not been tracking compliance, you may not discover the default until a problem occurs — at which point the damage is already done.

**Audit failures.** Property management companies are frequently audited by lenders, investors, and insurance carriers. A finding that COI tracking is inconsistent or incomplete can result in increased insurance premiums, required remediation plans, or loss of management contracts.

**Increased insurance costs.** Your own property insurance carrier may increase premiums if they determine that third-party insurance is not being adequately verified. Some carriers require evidence of a COI tracking program as a condition of coverage.

**Reputational risk.** A major incident involving an uninsured vendor reflects poorly on the property management firm, regardless of who is technically at fault.

## Best Practices for COI Management

Effective COI management does not require perfection on day one. It requires consistent processes and clear expectations.

### Define requirements by vendor and tenant type

Not every vendor needs the same coverage. A landscaping company has different risk characteristics than an electrical contractor. Create requirement templates based on the type of work being performed or the nature of the tenancy. At minimum, define requirements for general liability, workers' compensation, automobile liability (if vehicles are used on-site), and umbrella/excess coverage.

### Collect COIs before work begins

Make it a policy that no vendor begins work and no tenant takes occupancy without a current, compliant COI on file. This is much easier to enforce at the start of a relationship than after work is underway.

### Track expiration dates proactively

Do not wait for certificates to expire. Set up a system to alert you 30 to 60 days before expiration so you have time to request an updated certificate. This is where manual tracking breaks down — a property manager with 100 vendors cannot reliably monitor 100 different expiration dates across multiple coverage types using a spreadsheet.

### Verify every certificate

Review each COI against your requirements when it is received. Confirm that coverage types, limits, endorsements, effective dates, and named entities all match what is required. Do not just file the document — actually read it.

### Document your process

Maintain a record of when certificates were received, reviewed, and any follow-up communications sent. This creates an audit trail that demonstrates due diligence.

### Follow up consistently

When a vendor or tenant is non-compliant — whether due to an expired policy, insufficient limits, or missing endorsements — follow up promptly. Send a clear notification explaining the gap and provide a deadline for resolution. If the gap is not resolved, enforce the consequences outlined in your contract or lease.

## How AI Is Changing COI Compliance

For decades, COI tracking has been a manual process. A property manager receives a PDF, opens it, reads through the ACORD form line by line, compares the values against a spreadsheet of requirements, and flags any issues. This process is slow, error-prone, and does not scale.

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing this workflow.

### Automated data extraction

Modern AI can read a COI PDF and extract all of the structured data — coverage types, limits, policy numbers, dates, carrier names, and entity information — in seconds. What used to take a property manager 10 to 15 minutes per certificate now happens automatically. The extracted data can be immediately compared against requirements to identify gaps.

### Consistent accuracy

Humans get fatigued. After reviewing the twentieth certificate of the day, it is easy to miss a limit shortfall or an expiration date that is only a few weeks away. AI applies the same level of scrutiny to every certificate, regardless of volume.

### Proactive monitoring

AI-powered platforms can automatically track expiration dates, send follow-up notifications to vendors and tenants, and escalate unresolved gaps to property managers. This shifts the process from reactive (discovering gaps after they cause problems) to proactive (preventing gaps from persisting).

### Entity verification

One of the more subtle compliance checks is verifying that the named insured on the certificate matches the vendor or tenant in your system. AI can perform fuzzy name matching to flag potential mismatches — catching issues like "Smith Contracting LLC" versus "Smith Contractors Inc." that a human reviewer might overlook during a quick scan.

### Self-service portals

Rather than emailing COI requests back and forth, AI-powered platforms can provide vendors and tenants with a self-service upload portal. The vendor uploads their certificate, the AI extracts and checks it automatically, and the property manager receives a notification only if review is needed. This reduces the administrative burden on both sides.

Tools like SmartCOI combine these capabilities into a single platform purpose-built for commercial property managers. Instead of maintaining spreadsheets, chasing emails, and manually reviewing every certificate, property managers can focus on resolving actual compliance issues while the system handles the data extraction, monitoring, and follow-up.

## Getting Started

If your organization is still tracking COIs manually, the first step is to acknowledge that the current process has gaps. Every property management firm that relies on spreadsheets and email eventually discovers — usually at the worst possible time — that a vendor's coverage lapsed months ago.

Start by auditing your current vendor and tenant roster. How many have a current COI on file? How many of those certificates have been checked against your actual requirements? The answers will likely make the case for a better system.

From there, define your requirements, establish a consistent process, and consider whether AI-powered tools can help you scale that process across your portfolio. The goal is simple: every vendor and tenant on every property should have current, compliant insurance coverage, verified and documented, at all times.

Your tenants and vendors expect you to protect the property. Your investors and lenders expect you to manage risk. And when something goes wrong, everyone will ask whether the insurance was in place. Make sure the answer is yes.
